## Performance Calculation Formula

```
Productivity Score (90% weight):
  Total Points = Sum of (Task Count × Task Base Score)
  Productivity % = (Total Points / 400) × 100
  Weighted = Productivity % × 0.90

Behavior Score (10% weight):
  Base = 100
  Minus: Idle Hours × 10 points
  Minus: Conduct Flag × 50 points
  Weighted = Base × 0.10

FINAL PERFORMANCE = Productivity + Behavior
```
